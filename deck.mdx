## What to expect

- Fiber algorithm
- JSX
- State
- Class and function based components
- Lifecycles
- Refs
- Context API ?
- Keys ?
- Hooks!!!

---

## Also

- some basic principles of React and JS
- requestIdleCallback API
- lot of boilerplate

---

## Approach

# Top down built "To do" App

# (what else?)

---

## What not to expect

- Not a contributor/maintainer of React
- Not a robust code
- Not to cover all the edgecases

---

## React stack

- No way to stop the diffing
- Recursive algorithm

---

## React fiber

```notes
Frameworks try to solve the same problems: abstraction over DOM manipulation.

# A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Github](https://github.com/facebook/react/)

# Describe

- virtual DOM
- speed
- JSX
- unilinear data flow
- declarative!! (API)
- component based!! (function)

```notes
Describe like in interviews, pros and cons, or blog posts. Component based === function composition.
```

---

# Functional programming

- components ~ functions
- stateful - stateless components (referentailly transparent functions)
- component composition ~ function composition
- declarative!! (API style !== implementation style)
